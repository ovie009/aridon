About Urukpe.

Urukpe is a custom chopping board with woven leather handle and adorned with art.

Crafted to be beautiful, functional and durable.

As our first product, Urukpe is significant and inspiring to us.
Venturing into the dark unknown caves of creativity, we at ARIDÃ“N needed a light(Urhukpe) to guide our wild willing legs to a place of ceaseless wonders; 
soothing warmth and swe'tened scents, where we can gracefully hoist our flags as a power house in contemporary Nigerian design.

Completely customizable to suit different artistic taste.


Perfect as a functional kitchen art
